The graph I  have created shows the distribution of age by survived status for the passengers on the Titanic. It is a scatter plot, which is a type of graph that shows the relationship between two variables by plotting points on a coordinate plane.
The x-axis of the graph represents the passengers' ages, and the y-axis represents their survived status, where 0 = no and 1 = yes. The size of each point represents the number of passengers in that age bin.
The graph shows that there is a clear relationship between age and survival status. Children were the most likely to survive, followed by women and men. The oldest passengers were the least likely to survive.
This graph is a good example of how exploratory data analysis (EDA) can be used to gain insights into a dataset. By visualizing the data in different ways, we can identify patterns and trends that might not be immediately obvious.
